# The Big Metal Unit mod
Download: https://github.com/D2-mods/D2-Mira/releases  
Supports: BG1(EE), BG2(EE), IWD(EE), IWD2, EET/BGT/IWD2EE


Overview:
-

This is a mod for Infinity Engine games (classic and EE versions). It was originally written for Icewind Dale: Enhanced Edition and Icewind Dale 2 in order to add the Big Metal Unit and related items into the games. The mod has since been expanded to include dialogue and item trading with various NPCs, several tweak options, as well as support for more games.

The exact stuff this mod adds will depend on the game. All items are obtainable in the IWD games (including pantaloons). The Big Metal Rod and a Pulse ammo are added to BG1/SoD (obtainable in both). For BG2/ToB, several items are added or revised, and there may be a small quest involved. There's also an option to start with a bag containing the core Big Metal items. More info below.

Components:
-

1. Main Component:
	- Option 1: Standard Installation
	- Option 2: Start with the core "Big Metal" items
2. Adjust APR and enchantment level (5 options, including vanilla BG2 stats)
3. Choose damage type for Frag Grenade (fire or slashing)
4. Make ammo more party friendly (see note below)
5. Pulse ammo does double damage on a critical hit (EEs)
6. Adjust ammo charges per day (default is unlimited)

**Component 4 info (party friendly ammo):**
- Protects allies from AoE ammo damage (ex. fire from scorcher).
- Does not block damage from the launcher.
- It still counts as a hit, so it will interrupt spellcasting.
- EEs/BG2 engine: this works for all AoE ammo.
- IWD1/IWD2 note: Frag Grenade only, scorcher damage can't be blocked.
- Neutral NPCs take no damage but may become hostile (depends on AI script).

Additional info:
-

**Option 1:**
- IWD games: All items are obtainable, including pantaloons. (more info below)
- BG1/SoD: Adds the Big Metal Rod and Pulse Ammo (prototype).
- BG2: Several items are added or revised (see below).
- Some are gained through trades, some are sold by merchants, and some can be found in various places.

**Option 2:**
- Party starts with a bag, containing the core Big Metal items. 
- Other items not in the bag will still be obtainable in the game (if normally available with Option 1). 
- Also compatible with Black Pits 1 & 2.

**BG2 notes:**
- Core items are still gained the same way as in the unmodded game.
- Pulse (prototype) and an extra Big Metal Rod are obtainable in SoA.
- Golden Pantaloons are in SoA, even if not importing from BG1. (note: if missed in the starting dungeon, it gets moved somewhere else)
- Pulse III is obtainable in ToB (requires trading in a lesser Pulse Ammo).

**A few hints:**
- IWD1: The Big Metal Rod is in the starting town. Make sure not to miss it (though there's different dialogue with an NPC if you do miss it).
- BG1: The Big Metal Rod will not appear at its location until you find out it exists.
- Throne of Bhaal: Gold/Silver pantaloons are still obtainable in ToB, if not already obtained.
- Heart of Winter: Any missing pantaloons, the Big Metal Rod, and a Pulse Ammo are obtainable if not found in the main IWD campaign.
- IWD2: Any missing pantaloons, the Big Metal Rod, and a Pulse Ammo are still obtainable after reaching Kuldahar, if you missed them in earlier locations.

--

**Trades info (IWDEE, IWD1, IWD2):**
- Big Metal Unit: requires the 3 pantaloons
- Pulse Ammunition: requires the Pulse (prototype)
- Pulse III: requires any lesser Pulse Ammo (regular or prototype)

**NOTE: You need to have the Big Metal Rod in possession to get the Pulse Ammo dialogues.**

**Known issues:**
- Big Metal Unit (classic IWD1): Does not change appearance. Will appear as a plate mail.
- Big Metal Unit (IWD2): Selection sounds will change to a creature sound, even after removing the armor. Save and reload (with the armor off) to return selection sounds back to normal.
